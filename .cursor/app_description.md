Challenger game rules:
Mode Note: only applicable to multiple board selection. if one board is selected challenger rules do not apply.
- Boards are ranked alphabetically, with Board A ranked highest and Board Z ranked lowest.
- if a player or a player pair WINS on a lower ranked board they are always promoted to a board that ranks higher than thei current board; for example if a player(s) wins on Board C, they are promoted to Board B(higher than theirt current board) and the winning players on Board B is promoted to Board A, and the Winners of Board A will remain in Board A until they reach 3 consecutive wins
- Players on the higest ranked board can ONLY remain on the board for 3 consecutive WINNING rounds.
- consecutive wins only count when you reach the highest ranked board, Board A; for example if a player(s) win on board C they are promoted to Board B, and then they win in a subsequent round on Board B and is moved to Board A, and win again on Board A. that will be the first count increment on their consecutive wins. they have the option to win 2 more times before being removed/benched OR reshuffled even if they win their 4th consecutive win on Board A.
- match style is always 2 versus 2, teams of 2 going against each other.
- Boards of a higher rank is always filled up; for example 2 v 2
- if 2 v 2 cannot be satisfied it is acceptable to populate a board with 1 versus 1 to accomodate fair play.

Player Rotation rules:
- the aim is to have as much paticipation as possible; for example if 7 players are playing, then Board A = 2v2, Board B = 1v1 and bench=1; if 9 players are selected with 2 boards; then Board A = 2v2, Board B = 2v2, bench =1; if 10 players are selected and 2 boards then Board A = 2v2, Board B = 2v2, bench = 2; if 10 are selected with 3 boards, then Board A = 2v2, Board B = 2v2, Board C = 1v1, Bench =0
- the aim of player rotation is to promte Fair gameplay all
- where possible all players HAVE to be paired with a different player they have not been paired with in the match.
- if they cannot be paired with someone new, they HAVE to be paired with a player they have been paired with the least amount of times.
- if they have been paired with all players an equal amount of time, then the pairings can be randomized.
- we have to avoid pairing the same people over and over in the same match.
- all players that have not won the current round, or that have reached their consecutive win Quota are returned to the available "Player Pool"
- the player pool is the only place where player pairings can be sourced from.
- players from the bench MUST play in the round after they have sat on the bench
- if it so happens that the player count is uneven, and the lowest ranked board was populated with 1v1, and 1 player is promoted for a WIN, they MUST be paired with a player from the available pool to match a board composition if it is 2v2

Bench rotation rules:
Bench Note: Bench is only applicable when there is a uneven player count or if all boards are fully populated and there are players not allocated to any board.
- player(s) CANNOT benched in consecutive rounds
- player(s) CANNOT be benched if there are players in the player pool that have not benched yet for example if their bench count is 0
- player(s) must be rotated in for an active match and matched with a player(s) from the player pool
- if players are coming out of a win streak(consecutive win streak) then they MUST be benched to force their fair bench rotation and provide fair play to players that have already benched.

Scoring rules:
- A win = 1 point
- A dove = 1 point, allocated to the winning team members
- each player in the winning team(s) is awared a win point for the win even if they are playing as part of a team.

Handicap Rules:
- each rank on the season leaderboard is awared a handicap
- the first two ranked position earns 1 times their round point.
- each 2 ranks lower gains 0.1 to the previous ranks handicap; for example ranks 3 and 4 will have a handicap of 1.1, ranks 9 and 10 will have a handicap of 1.4 etc
- handicap is taked from the current leaderboard and used for the duration of the match.
- handicap is adjusted after the full match is completed.

- Losses
- Player pair win rate as percentage
- Player pairing count (amount of times played together)
