# Darts League Web App - Step-by-Step Plan & Implementation Progress

Welcome to the project roadmap! This document details all the steps we need to crush this project and keeps track of our progress along the way. Think of it as the game plan for our darts league app. ðŸŽ¯ðŸ”¥

---

## Step 1: Project Setup
- **Task:** Initialize the Vite project with React and TypeScript.
- **Action:** Run the following command in your terminal:
  ```bash
  npm create vite@latest darts-league -- --template react-ts
  cd darts-league
  npm install
  ```
- **Dependencies:** Install essential dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install styled-components react-router-dom @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
  npm install --save-dev @types/styled-components
  ```
- **Status:** Not executed yet (but instructions are crystal clear!).

---

## Step 2: Directory Structure Setup
- **Task:** Create a clean structure with the following directories and files:
  - `src/components` - Reusable UI components.
  - `src/pages` - Page-level components (Game Screen, Player Management, Admin Console).
  - `src/store` - Redux store configuration and slices.
  - `src/App.tsx` & `src/main.tsx` - The main entry points for the app.
- **Status:** Planned. Directories and initial file structure need to be created.

---

## Step 3: Create Entry Files
- **Task:** Build the entry point:
  - `src/main.tsx` hooks up React, Redux Provider, and React Router.
  - `src/App.tsx` sets up basic routing.
- **Status:** Example code provided; pending actual implementation.

---

## Step 4: Implement Routing
- **Task:** Configure React Router in `src/App.tsx` to navigate between:
  - **Game Screen**
  - **Player Management**
  - **Admin Console**
- **Status:** Sample code ready; implementation pending.

---

## Step 5: Setup Redux Toolkit
- **Task:** Configure the Redux store:
  - Create `src/store/store.ts`.
  - Set up slices to manage app-wide state (e.g., player data, match state).
- **Status:** Planned, not implemented yet.

---

## Step 6: Establish Main Pages
- **Task:** Develop sample pages/components:
  - **GameScreen:** Displays match info, grid layout for boards, round timer.
  - **PlayerManagement:** Manage player data.
  - **AdminConsole:** Handles admin operations.
- **Status:** Planned, to be implemented.

---

## Next Steps & Future Ideas
- **Integrate Styled Components:** Apply our dark theme consistently across all components.
- **Setup Testing:** Utilize Jest and React Testing Library for robust testing.
- **Feature Enhancements:**
  - **S1:** Real-time updates via WebSockets.
  - **S2:** Advanced animations and visual effects for a polished user experience.
  - **S3:** Detailed analytics and reporting in the Admin Console.
